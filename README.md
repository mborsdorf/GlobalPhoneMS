# GlobalPhoneMS_Scripts
Here we distribute the scripts to recreate the GlobalPhone Mix-to-Separate (GlobalPhoneMS) databases.

> Important: The Apache 2.0 license applies to the scripts to generate the GlobalPhoneMS. You can get access to the used GlobalPhone database (GlobalPhone 2000 Speaker Package) by purchasing a research or commercial license (https://catalog.elra.info/en-us/repository/browse/ELRA-S0400/).
