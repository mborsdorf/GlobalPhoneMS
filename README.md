# GlobalPhoneMS_Scripts
Here we distribute the scripts to recreate the GlobalPhoneMS databases. We also show some experimental results and refere our contributions.

> Important: The Apache 2.0 license applies to the scripts to generate the GlobalPhoneMS. You can get access to the used GlobalPhone database (GlobalPhone 2000 Speaker Package) by purchasing a research or commercial license (https://catalog.elra.info/en-us/repository/browse/ELRA-S0400/).

## GlobalPhoneMS2
### To do:
- [ ] Create hierarchical structure (so far just GlobalPhoneMS2)
- [ ] Uploade utterance lists

- [ ] Housekeeping (references, description, etc.)
